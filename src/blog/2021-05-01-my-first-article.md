description: A Vue.js application that allows a user to view and manipulate data about courses, lecturers and enrolments at a college.

This project I worked on was part of a CA I had for one of my 3rd year modules called Web Application Frameworks. This CA in particular focuses on Front-end development and UX/UI. Access to the data of the college was provided by a REST API which was implemented within a Laravel application. This application was then to be extended by building a Vue front-end application that allows a user to login and, once they are logged in, to view, create, edit and delete enrolments, lecturers and courses. 

Once this project was completed it was successfully hosted, check it out! https://college-vue-jodie.web.app/

To login to the college system the username is 'sam@bloggs.com' and the password is 'secret'. Don't tell anyone!

Below is a demonstration video of the application in which I give a quick demo of what in contains.
