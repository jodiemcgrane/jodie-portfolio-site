This project I worked on was from my Professional Practice module in 3rd year of college. The aim of the module was for us students to undertake a project that involves the design and implementation of a software application in a workplace environment. This project was carried out in groups of two, me and my project partner Caol√°n. As this project was managed using the Scrum methodology, therefore our project teams was assigned a project supervisor, fulfilling the role of scrum master and product owner and us two as the development team.

<h2>Phase 1</h2>

The first phase of the project involved the team researching into applications target market such as creating personas, conducting interviews and questionnaires, creating empathy maps, developing scenarios for our personas, and then developing prototypes to solve the personas interaction in the scenario.

This part of the project was also a continuous assessment for another module called Interaction Design. All research, prototypes and evaluations can be found in a Miro board I created where me and my project partner worked together developing our project.
